version:        0.1.0
synopsis:       Container wrappers with typed-key APIs
description:    Wraps @IntMap@ and @IntSet@ in APIs that allow using newtypes over @Int@ for
                their keys/indices.  (This is everything from @containers@ that's suitable
                for this transformation).
                .
                Admittedly it's a bit weird to call this a "keyed" @IntSet@.  I haven't been
                able to come up with a name that isn't worse.
